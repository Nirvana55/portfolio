"Life can be tough. This is just a piece of my story"

Entering the tech world and adapting to corporate life can be eye opening. Initially, I believed community of humble and friendly individuals, all eager to learn and grow together.
\n However, reality often presents a different picture.

Everyone's journey is different. They share their experiences. Learning from them is valuable, but it's crucial to filter through their advice. In my opinion, humans can be compared to a vehicle. If it is overloaded, it cannot function efficiently. They simply have to dump their belongings. Instead of processing, we might find ourselves dumping unnecessary weight, often targeting those who seem less powerful. This practice is more common in corporate environments than we'd like to admit. It's a race, indeed, but don't let it weigh you down. In the grand scheme, these challenges are minor.

The competition in the workplace is real and can be daunting. It's essential to remember that there's a world beyond our office walls. Why should we let these pressures consume us? Learning and teaching are two sides of the same coin. Without guidance, unlocking our potential becomes a harder task. Sometimes, all it takes is a small push to make a significant difference.

The tech world is vast, like an ocean filled with countless species. Knowing one doesn't mean you understand them all. It's unfair to judge someone based on a single skill. Remember, we were all beginners once, struggling with basic tasks. It's important to acknowledge our growth and the journey it took to get here.

I believe that remaining humble, hustling, and sharing what you learn will make things better. However, as previously stated, most people do not understand. If you're struggling, don't worry: "One day you'll look foolish, but don't be that fool tomorrow." Struggle exists on every field. But I believe I did not panic about the situation. I used to work as hard as I could at home to boost my confidence.
Do not ever lose your confidence.

This blog might feel different for everyone. You know because it is your perception.
I just want to say that you should be humble. Help a friend. Do not panic. Do not lose confidence.
This struggle you're going through is just one part of the story.

On the other half, you will meet good friends who are in the same boat. Making jokes. Laughing. Sharing thoughts. Making moments. Traveling with them. Bitching.
Eating local foods. Learning new things. Celebrating your unplanned birthday. Many more.
You will miss them a lot and these memories will become a cherished part of your story.
I miss you guys.

PS: p\*\*g bro for pushing me to write blogs. If you reading this, thanks man. Will try my best to continue it.
