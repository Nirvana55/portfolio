With the ups and downs of life, the time has come to begin over with a new year. Because the past is history and the future is a mystery, perhaps the moment we should be focusing on is the now. With a determined attitude and a clear aim in mind, I believe there will be no stopping this time. Wallah uninstalled every game.

I've been surfing the internet for a long time. Technology has come a long way. As I moved from html, CSS, and vanilla JS to react, it seemed like I was entering a new generation from the Stone Age. I was astounded to see so many individuals working so hard to make programming simple. I have a lot of respect for them.

This year, I'll be focused on becoming a competent developer and writing a lot of articles about the things I learn every day and the challenges I experience along the way. My goal for this year is to learn React in depth using Typescript and other libraries such as

(1) StoryBook
(2) Cypress
(3) Prisma

By the end of the year, I aim to be a developer contributing to the react community and multiple open source projects. Many internal projects are also on my mind, some of which I have already started. I'm hoping that this year will be a good start for the software that will be released.

PS: Available for freelance work :D
